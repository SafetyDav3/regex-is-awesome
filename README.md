# Regex Tutorial Starter Code# You Need to Learn Regular Expressions Right Now!

This tutorial will cover Regular Expressions more commonly referred to as "RegEx". To me the most interesting aspect of RegEx is that it can be used in all*¹ programming languages. 
RegEx can be considered a universal language of sorts due to this cross compatibility.<br>
The most common applications for RegEx are Find, replace, and validation of string type data.  

## Summary

This tutorial os sorts will cover probably the most common use case for RegEx and that's email validation. Below is an example of an email validation Regular Expression.↓
<br>
<br>
    `/^([a-zA-Z0-9._%-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6})*$/gm`
<br>
<br>
In the following material we will cover what every bit of this wild looking syntax tells the program to do preform. And how to apply it many other scenario.

## Regex Components

<br>


### Anchors
<br>
Anchors are used to match the position of a character. This is useful for determining if a string starts, ends with, is preceded by, or followed by a character(s).

<br>

#### Examples
<br>

`^` Is used to find a paramator at the start of a string or line - `^foo.*`
